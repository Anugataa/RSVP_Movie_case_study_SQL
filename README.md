# The Problem Statement 

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. The data of the movies that have been released in the past three years have been provided. We have to analyze the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project and have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights. For our convenience, the entire analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. There are 29 questions in total.

# My Approach
I was provided with ERD and the complete dataset with all the tables.
I have gone through the data thoroughly before starting with the assignment. It gave me a good sense of what all the columns represent, which is a good practice to follow before proceeding with the analysis.
I read through each of the instructions carefully, identified the task to be performed, and proceeded to write the required code. I made sure that the solution output was in the expected format if given in the question.
I have used appropriate aliases for the variable names.
I have tried to write optimized codes. Used appropriate tables and joins as per the questions asked.

# Summary
Highest no. of movies (3052) were produced in year 2017.
And if we consider monthly trend; maximum
movies released in March (824) and lowest in December (438) in a span of three years 2017 to 2019.
And out of all 13 genres, the maximum movies were from Drama genre with average of 106 minutes duration.

RSVP should consider following factors while producing its next movie:
- The Genre, it should be preferred as Drama and duration should be around 106 minutes.
- The Director, it should be James Mangold, as he has highest average rating of 8+ among the top 3
  genres with max movie count.
- The Production House, RSVP can partner with Dream Warrior Pictures or National Theatre Live for next
  project, as these two production companies have highest hit movie counts with average rating of 8.
- For The Lead Roles If RSVP has a script for:
- Worldwide audience then they should consider Mammootty. He has worldwide fanbase and has 8 movies with
  median rating > 8.
- Indian audience then should cast Vijay Sethupathi and Taapsee Pannu. Their weighted average rating is
  highest with 8.42 and 7.70.
- The Timing, RSVP must avoid March and prefer December to get maximum coverage since competing
  movies are very few.
- If they want to go for a global partnership; Marvel Studios (Rank 1), Twentieth Century Fox (2) or
  Warner Bros.(3) can be chosen. They have garnered highest number of votes.
